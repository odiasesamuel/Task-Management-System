# Task Management System

A comprehensive microservices-based web application designed to help teams manage their projects and tasks efficiently. Built with Spring Boot and JHipster, this system provides a scalable solution for project management, task tracking, and team collaboration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects simultaneously
- **Task Assignment & Tracking**: Create, assign, and monitor tasks with priorities and deadlines
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical user roles with granular permissions
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Task comments, file attachments, and notifications
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on project and individual performance
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable service-oriented design

### Services Overview

1. **Service Discovery (Eureka Server)**: Facilitates the discovery of services within the microservices architecture.
2. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests for route management and load balancing
3. **Authentication Service**: Manages user registration, login, and generates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication.
4. **User Service**: Manages all non-authentication-related user data (User profiles, roles, and team management)
5. **Project Service**: Manages projects and tracks their overall progress.
6. **Task Service**: Manages tasks, including creation, assignment, tracking, and collaboration features like comments and attachments.
7. **Notification Service**: A non-database service that sends real-time notifications and email alerts by listening to events from other services.
8. **Reporting Service**: Aggregates data from multiple services to generate reports on task completion, project progress, and individual performance.

## üë• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control system with three primary roles:

### üî¥ Admin
- **Scope**: System-wide administrative privileges
- **Permissions**:
  - Full user management (create, update, delete users)
  - Role assignment and management
  - Team creation and management across all teams
  - Project creation and management across all projects
  - Task creation, assignment, and management across all projects
  - Access to all reports and analytics
  - System configuration and settings

### üü° Team Lead
- **Scope**: Manager-level privileges with elevated access across teams
- **Key Feature**: Team Leads have manager-level privileges and are **not restricted to specific teams**
- **Permissions**:
  - Team management across **any team** in the system
  - Project creation and management across **all projects**
  - Task creation, assignment, and management across **all projects**
  - User assignment to any team
  - Access to reports for all teams and projects
  - Can view and manage tasks across all teams

> **Important Note**: Team Leads are not just leads for a specific team - they have elevated privileges across the entire system, functioning as middle management with broad oversight capabilities.

### üü¢ Member (Team Member)
- **Scope**: Limited to assigned teams and projects
- **Permissions**:
  - View team information for assigned teams only
  - View and update tasks assigned to them
  - View projects associated with their teams
  - Add comments and attachments to tasks they're involved in
  - Update their own profile information
  - View reports related to their own performance

### Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Admin | Team Lead | Member |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| User Management | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

### Notifications Service
#### Task Assignment Notification
The Task Management service sends an event to the Notifications service when a task is created or assigned. The event payload would contain the task_id, assigned_to_user_id, and due_date. The Notifications service would then fetch the user's details from the User Management service to send an email or an in-app alert.

#### Collaboration Notifications
The Task Management service sends an event to the Notifications service whenever a comment is added to a task. The event payload would include the task_id, comment and the user_id of the commenter. The Notifications service would then notify all other users involved in that task.
